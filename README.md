# Code for running the model and analyses of vegetation dynamics in drylands

This repository contains the code used to perform simulations and the postprocessing for both main text and supplementary informations.

Contact: Beno√Æt Pichon, **benoit.pichon0@gmail.com**

All the code was made on R (*v4.1.0*) and Julia (*1.7.3*).

Here is the different steps to reproduce the figures:


## `Installing Julia dependancies`

To install julia dependancies go into your working directory, press "]" and enter "activate .". Once activating the local folder, all dependancies can be loaded using "instantiate".


## `Replicating the figures`

**0.** The file `Dryland_shift_function.R` and `Dryland_shift_Nspecies_function.jl` contain all functions necessary to run the code for the ODEs models and the spatially explicit one. 

**1.** To run all analyses made with two species, you cade run the codes:
    - `Dryland_shift_main.R` for the non-spatial simulations
    - For the spatially explicit simulations done with 2 species, run the code `Dryland_shift_Nspecies_main.jl` (**regions 1 to 5**). 

**3.** To run the analysis for N-species, you can run the file `Dryland_shift_Nspecies_main.jl` (**regions 6 to 9**). Note that simulations with 15 and 25 species using pair approximation takes some time run. It took about **1.5 days on a 25 cores CPU**. The code is nevertheness parallalized: you can change the number of cores used in the file. 
Simulatations are then post-processed using `Dryland_shift_main.R` script.

**4.** Once simulations are made and post-processed, all figures can be generated using the same file `Make_figures.R`. The code is organized by figures: a figure per chunk of code.



## `Exploring the model`


### Model description

    <b>Figure 1: Trait based plant community model in arid ecosystems.</b>
</p>

The model describes the temporal changes of a landscape of $n \times n$ sites.
Each site can be in one of $N+2$ states: colonized by the plant $i$ ($+_i$), with a fertile soil ($0$) or in a degraded soil state ($-$).
The transitions between the different states are probabilistic and depend on the local neighborhood of a focal site (*e.g.* the local vegetation density) and the trait of the plants (Fig. 1a).



### A toy example


First, take a spatially explicit example.

```julia

include("Dryland_shift_Nspecies_function.jl") #loading the functions


Nsp = 5 #number of species
p = Get_classical_param_dict(N_species=Nsp, alpha_e=0.1, #level of interspecific competition
            scenario_trait="spaced", cintra=0.3) #species traits are equally spaced along the trade-off axis 

state = Get_initial_lattice_Nspecies(param=p, size_mat=100, branch="Degradation", type_ini="equal") #intial lattice

d2, landscape = Gillespie_CA_N_species(; param=copy(p), landscape=copy(state), tmax=1000, type_competition="global") #Simulate the dynamics

Plot_dynamics_Nspecies(d=d2, Nsp=5) # temporal dynamics

Plot_landscape_Nspecies(landscape) # spatial organization of the vegetation

```

We can also simulate the temporal dynamics of this 5-species community with the pair-approximation model .



```julia


Nsp = 5

p = Get_classical_param_Nspecies(N_species=Nsp,
    alpha_e=0.1, scenario_trait="spaced", cintra=0.3)

state = Get_initial_state(Nsp=Nsp, type="equal", branch="Degradation", PA=true)
prob = ODEProblem(PA_N_species, state, (0, 5000), p)
sol = solve(prob, callback=TerminateSteadyState(1e-8)) #solving the pair approximation model

dyn = Reorder_dynamics(sol) #to reorder the output of DifferentialEquation package
Plot_dynamics_Nspecies(d=dyn, Nsp=Nsp) 

# Note that you can also run the mean-field model by changin PA = false in the Get_initial_state function and
# calling MF_N_species in the ODEProblem instead of PA_N_species. 
```
